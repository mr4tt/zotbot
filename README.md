Using standard detection datasets, we train patterns that suppress the objectness scores produced by a range of commonly used detectors, and ensembles of detectors. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark the effectiveness of adversarially train...

We then exte...

Its body structure consists of three legs that are asymmetric to the body, so it cannot be easily balanced. In addition, the actuator is a servo motor that can only feed-forward r...
